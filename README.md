# SemiVanilla MC

Thie repo contains the configs for the TEST server. This server should be kept identical to the production server at all times. Drift is important to avoid.

Note: There are a few necessary changes to make the test server work on different hardware and identify itself as the test server.

Note: Differences between servers while testing are, of course, necessary. But they should either be implemented in prod or reverted, not left forever (causing drift).

Note: Jars will have to be re-downloaded! [Server wiki](https://github.com/SemiVanilla-MC/wiki) listing active plugins and server version should be kept updated!
